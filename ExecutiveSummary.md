##Executive Summary

This system is designed to help the developers and managers to look up and retrieve the nescessary licenses and vulnerabilities they need in order to use certain software packages, and the policies they have for them.
This eliminates the human factor error-wise, and also increases the productivity of workers.

The expected outcome of implementing this system would be higher productivity, less errors, better workflow, and increased control of project information.

The use of open source databases like NIST and FOSSology to help look for vulnerabilities and licenses makes it easier for the company to stay updated with the rest of the open source community.
